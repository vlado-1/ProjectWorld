Below I have added additional information about the topics I have displayed on my website.
I add more information about what I have done in pursuit of my hobbies, what I've learned 
at university, and what I do at work.

Hobby - Unity Game Development

Developed games using the Unity Game Engine with Visual Studio Code editor used for writing C# code.
Familiar with the basic concepts of GameObjects, Components, Monobehaviour Scripts, Object Oriented Programming
and Assets in the form of animations, music, and 3D/2D models. I have experience writing basic
2D and 3D games. All game development has been done during the Unity Learning Pathway, for usually
no more than an hour or two a day. On the Unity Learning website I have 16 badges at the time of
providing this information, and have completed both the 'Unity Essentials' and 'Junior Programmer'
pathways. I am also familiar with the way the Unity Game engine can build games so that they can
be playable on another platform - in this case for Internet - WebGL, and for Desktop - Windows. 

Some of the beginner level games I've created which are playable as they are posted on Unity Play and marked
for the public include:

- Game Title: 'Road Obstacles Game'
-- Github link: https://github.com/vlado-1/Programming-Theory-Repo
-- Task was to develop a game from scratch that encapsulated the 4 Object Oriented Programming concepts
of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. I used some assets that I obtained
from an earlier tutorial and created a top-down mouse controlled car game where you control
a vehicle from the start of a road to the finish, and avoid obstacles along the way. Collisions with obstacles 
can potentially either do nothing, stop you, or eliminate you thus forcing you to start again.
Obstacle class with specialized child classes (inheritance); child classes have different ways of 
handling collisions (polymorphism); variable access modifiers in some files are set to 
private (encapsulation); and specialized methods for starting/ending game, moving vehicle, 
and spawning obstacles (abstraction).

- Game Title: 'Brick Breaker with High Score'
-- Github Link: https://github.com/vlado-1/Unity-Data-Persistence-Project
-- Provided with an existing Brick Breaker game, my task was to extend the game so as to support
data persistence between screens and between sessions. To accomplish the first objective I used
a singleton class that was loaded only once, and which stored data that could be accessed from
different screens. To accomplish the second object, I had to write information into a file, and read
it from the file when the game launches, this way accomplishing persistence of data between sessions.
In order to write the data more easily, I utilized the serializabile attribute of classes and their data
so that they could easily be converted to a json file when needed, and vice versa the data can be loaded
into a class from the json. Here is a link to the Unity Play website where you can play my game

- Game Title: 'Cheesy Freeze'
-- Github Link: https://github.com/vlado-1/Jnr-Unity-Programmer-Project
-- Provided with the task to make a video game from scratch, and to incorporate everything I had learned
in the Junior Developer pathway. After some brainstorm I decided to make a 2D game where you control
a penguin model and move left/right, jump as ice falls from the sky and cheese spawns occasionally as 
a powerup you can collect as the penguin and gain the ability to shoot cheese. The ice falling from the sky
is gradually lowering the temperature of the surroundings and once it reaches a certain minimum you lose.
The goal of the game is then to destroy as much ice cubes that are falling from the sky, and collect
as high a score as possible from the destroyed ice cubes until you eventually lose. The difficulty, that
is the amount of ice falling from the sky, gradually ramps up over time. To create the game I used free
3D models fron the Unity asset store for the penguin, ice cubes and cheese. I also found some sound affects
online to play when the player destroys an ice cube or eats some cheese. I also had to create a Text Mesh Pro UI
and link the main menu and game play unity scenes so that at the press of a start/quit button the user can traverse between them.

Hobby - Website Development

I have tried making two websites using the Angular framework for the frontend, and an SQL-style database for the data backend.
Thier differences lie in why and how they were built. I built 'Project One' before I understood how to host a website on GitHub
to figure out not only how to use Angular but also how to connect a backend server and database so that the whole functions as a typical website I
see on the internet (though not hosted on a domain like one). The technology stack I used required a backend server which couldn't be run on the statically hosted GitHub pages. 
Therefore I built 'World of Vlado Smolovic' in order to develop a website I can host entirely on GitHub pages. I built 'Project One' with no more help than that provided by google,
whereas I built 'World of Vlado Smolovic' with significant help from Google Gemini AI in building a prototype and refining the globe graphics on the site.
Over the course of the development of these sites, I have had the chance to thoroughly practice git version control from standard committing to merging, branching and rebasing though
primarily via the UI in the VS Code Git integration.

- Website Name: 'Project One
The website essentially displays a list of projects that I've done as previewed markdown content and in addition
contains some additional functionality that I added to showcase my ability to program various things. The markdown
is editabke via the site and in order for most of the site's functionality to become available to the user
they must sign in to the website. The site is stylized with css bootstrap. This was the first website I added
to Github Pages and the one in which I learned that a backed server and database server can be hosted.
-- Architecture and Design
The website was build using an Angular v17 front-end, with a ExpressJS framwork of NodeJS backend connected to a MySQL database server.
The frontend communicates with the backend server using REST APIs which are routed by the backend to database 
calls or internal logic. The design of the site as a whole follows the MVC pattern (Model View Controller).
The angular components on the frontend display/view the data, whilst the backend NodeJS server acts as a controller both
making requests to the database and sending responses back to the frontend which contain data that gets displayed.
-- List of Features
> Project List - Wrote Angular component that display a list of projects, and provided the user with options
to add, remove or edit existing project list items. The project list is stored in a table inside the MySQL database
and requires REST interactions with the database backend. The details of each project are displayed when the user
clicks on a list item, and is display in a markdown editor - either in edit or preview mode. The markdown editor
belongs to a thirdparty library called 'ngx-markdown-editor'. The editor content is stored as text in MySQL when saved.
> Login - added a Google Sign In button that opened a popup for sign-in. Used Google generated html
to imbed the button into my site. It relies on Google's Identity Services to authenticate the user and return a JWT to 
the frontend. I then send the JWT to the backend and validate it to makesure it is legitimate, and then check if the user
exists in my MySQL DB, and if not then authentication fails. As part of this authentication process I also create a
cookie if the authentication is a success, so that my frontend knows if the user is logged in when the screen refreshes for instance.
> Server-based web scraper - 
Implemented a web page in which you can enter the URL of a website, and then all the text in that website will be
displayed in a display area below the search bar. I used the playwright library in my backend NodeJS server to automate
the webscraping, which spawned a headless chrome browser and scraped DOM text elements (p tags) from the web page.
> Algorithm testing and results page
As part of a desire to practice writing some algorithms, as well as see what sort of affect a change in input size had on
the run time, I developed an angular webpage that ran algorithms via a custom service class I made, and then displayed
the results in a visual column graph that I used the chartjs library to display. The algorithms I implemented include: L
ongest Increasing Subsequence and Subset Sum.
Most of these features were developed by branching the main development branch, and then merging the results back in
once they were finished. Issue progress was recorded in GitHub issues.

- Website Name: 'World of Vlado Smolovic'
After developing 'Project One' and seeing that it could not be deployed without a domain and web server to run the ExpressJS backend with
MySQL DB, I decided to make a simpler and cleaner website that acts as a more direct and impactful portfolio page than the former site.
The idea I came up with was to display information about the projects I've done in a unique fashion, namely by sing a clickable globe
that the user can interact with to show the main information, and have a chatbot give the user any additional information about my projects
that they desire.
-- Architecture and Design
I decided to use a technology stack that could be run solely by the frontend. I decided to keep Angular so I could be more familiar with it,
and for the data storage technology decided to use SQLite which can be read on the front-end without need for a backend. The DB contains 
information on each of the project's I've done which I add before I deploy the new website.
-- List of Features
> Globe
To create an interactive 3D globe on my webpage I used the threejs library for WebGL, and created an initial Prototype using Gemini AI.
I then tinked with the template in order to add markers/images to the globe as textures which can be clicked in order to display
a popup with more information about what the image is refering to. All markers and associated information that are display on the globe are
stored as SQLite backup data that is read on the frontend and displayed. To simplify the code for interacting with 3D objects using
mouse events, I use the three.ez library for threejs to make eventhandling much simpler and more intuitive. The alternative would require
determining what sort of rays a mouse click would generate, and what kind of 3D object it would intersect.
> Chatbot
I decided to use Chatbase in order to train a chatbot agent on a private text file I made which contains additional information about each of
the projects/achievements I display on the globe. Chatbase then provides me with some template html code to use in order to display the textbox
area for my chatbot on my website.
