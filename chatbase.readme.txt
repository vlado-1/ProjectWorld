Below I have added additional information about the topics I have displayed on my website.
I add more information about what I have done in pursuit of my hobbies, what I've learned 
at university, and what I do at work.

Hobby - Unity Game Development

Developed games using the Unity Game Engine with Visual Studio Code editor used for writing C# code.
Familiar with the basic concepts of GameObjects, Components, Monobehaviour Scripts, Object Oriented Programming
and Assets in the form of animations, music, and 3D/2D models. I have experience writing basic
2D and 3D games. All game development has been done during the Unity Learning Pathway, for usually
no more than an hour or two a day. On the Unity Learning website I have 16 badges at the time of
providing this information, and have completed both the 'Unity Essentials' and 'Junior Programmer'
pathways. 
Some public github links to my projects include:

- Task was to develop a game from scratch that encapsulated the 4 Object Oriented Programming concepts
of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. I used some assets that I obtained
from an earlier tutorial and created a top-down mouse controlled car game where you control
a vehicle from the start of a road to the finish, and avoid obstacles along the way. Collisions with obstacles 
can potentially either do nothing, stop you, or eliminate you thus forcing you to start again.
Obstacle class with specialized child classes (inheritance); child classes have different ways of 
handling collisions (polymorphism); variable access modifiers in some files are set to 
private (encapsulation); and specialized methods for starting/ending game, moving vehicle, 
and spawning obstacles (abstraction).

https://github.com/vlado-1/Unity-Data-Persistence-Project
- Provided with an existing Brick Breaker game, my task was to extend the game so as to support
data persistence between screens and between sessions. To accomplish the first objective I used
a singleton class that was loaded only once, and which stored data that could be accessed from
different screens. To accomplish the second object, I had to write information into a file, and read
it from the file when the game launches, this way accomplishing persistence of data between sessions.
In order to write the data more easily, I utilized the serializabile attribute of classes and their data
so that they could easily be converted to a json file when needed, and vice versa the data can be loaded
into a class from the json. Here is a link to the Unity Play website where you can play my game
